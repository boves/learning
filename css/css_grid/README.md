I can't figure out why 11b doesn't work... I need to look into this!
Too tired to do anything. At a wedding. Will work on this tomorrow!
Ok, way too tired again, and I don't have time to write code. I'm going to head out and see if there's any music to be found around town in Doolin.

I got stuck out of the house today and couldn't get to a desk to code. So, yet again another commit!
Omg same.
Well, this trip has been really unproductive for coding hahaha. That's ok, I'm glad that I kept writing here, though! I didn't realize I ran out of the tutorial that I was going through.
Well, it's really late, but I'm finally home. Definitely not coding. Goodnight!
