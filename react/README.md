# Cloned repository
https://ibaslogic.com/zustand-react-state-management/

The `react-state-mgnt-starter` is a repository I cloned as part of the `react-todo-app` tutorial series. I'm not sure why they're having us clone a new repository, but I'm guessing it's because it's complicated enough to get started that he wants to give us some pieces to get started. Either that, or he wants to make sure that everything works before we start adding to it. At any rate, there it is!

I also removed the git tracking files from the repository because git complained.
